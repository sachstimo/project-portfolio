# Machine Learning & Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Below, you'll find an overview of the machine learning and data projects I have worked on. These projects reflect my focus on creating practical, impactful solutions through data analysis, machine learning, and cloud integration. I will continue to add to this list as I work on more projects.

**[3. Simple APIs](/03_Simple-APIs/)**
- Simple Language detection API
- Spotify playlist analyzer

**[4. Others](/04_Others/)**
- **Pharmacy Sales Analysis** using **R**: Identifying the top 20 pharmacies with the highest sales for a given product category
- [Secret Santa Email Bot](https://github.com/sachstimo/secret-santa-mailer): Automatically assign Secret Santa recipients and email them directly


# Further projects

### 1. Predicting Startup Success (startup-prediction-modelling)
Developed descriptive analysis and machine learning models in Python to predict the success of startups using a confidential dataset during my Master thesis for my MSc in Finance & Accounting

**Link to project:** [startup-prediction-modeling](https://github.com/sachstimo/startup-prediction-modeling.git)

- Dataset size: 800 rows (Global VC portfolio)
- Used Logistic Regression, SVM and XGBoost to identify feature importance for future investment success prediction


## 2. Mood-based Spotify Song recommendation using Flask 
Flask API combined with HTML to give song recommendations based on a user-selected mood.

**Link to project:** [song-of-the-day](https://github.com/sachstimo/song-of-the-day.git)

**Production version**: [app.timosachs.de](app.timosachs.de)

- Spotify API /recommendations endpoint to return song recommendation for a given set of mood features (Valence, Danceability, Speediness, etc.)
- Deployed on Docker container in my VPS using Nginx as reverse proxy


## 4. Donor Segmentation & Prediction Showcase
Built a showcase project to segment donors and predict donation behavior, specifically for nonprofit organizations.

- Hosted open-source service **[Briefer](https://github.com/briefercloud/briefer.git)** in Docker container on virtual private server with a separate database using Supabase for enhanced connectivity.
- Developed donor segmentation strategies and predictive analytics with Data analytics team of 180 Degrees Consulting.
- Demonstrated how nonprofits can optimize their fundraising efforts using data-driven insights.

- Created [pull request](https://github.com/briefercloud/briefer/pull/258) for Briefer open-source repository to enhance beginner setup experience


## 5. Web Scraping ESG Supplier Data (Consulting project)

>**Note:** Code cannot be released due to IP belonging to the client
Developed a MVP to scrape and analyze ESG data from supplier websites.

- Automated data collection for ESG metrics based on CSV upload of bank statement
- Prepared data for analysis to support corporate decision-making processes.





## **Interests Across Projects**
- **Practical Applications**: Delivering solutions with measurable business and social impact, such as donor behavior prediction and startup success modeling.
- **Data-Centric**: Focus on data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Cloud Integration**: Learnings in bringing ML services into production leveraging cloud services (e.g., AWS, Supabase).
