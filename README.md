# Further projects

## 1. Predicting Startup Success (startup-prediction-modelling)

- **Link to project:** [startup-prediction-modeling](https://github.com/sachstimo/startup-prediction-modeling.git)
- **Description**: Developed descriptive analysis and machine learning models in Python to predict the success of startups using a confidential dataset during my Master thesis for my MSc in Finance & Accounting
- **Key Features**:
  - Dataset size: 800 rows (Global VC portfolio)
  - Used Logistic Regression, SVM and XGBoost to identify feature importance for future investment success prediction


## 2. Mood-based Spotify Song recommendation using Flask 

- **Link to project:** [song-of-the-day](https://github.com/sachstimo/song-of-the-day.git)
- **Production version**: [app.timosachs.de](app.timosachs.de)
- **Description**: Created a Flask API combined with HTML to give song recommendations based on a user-selected mood.
- **Key Features**:
  - Spotify API /recommendations endpoint to return song recommendation for a given set of mood features (Valence, Danceability, Speediness, etc.)
  - Deployed on Docker container in my VPS using Nginx as reverse proxy


## 4. Donor Segmentation & Prediction Showcase
- **Dashboard available here:**
- **Description**: Built a showcase project to segment donors and predict donation behavior, specifically for nonprofit organizations.
- **Key Features**:
  - Hosted open-source service **[Briefer](https://github.com/briefercloud/briefer.git)** in Docker container on virtual private server with a separate database using Supabase for enhanced connectivity.
  - Developed donor segmentation strategies and predictive analytics with Data analytics team of 180 Degrees Consulting.
  - Demonstrated how nonprofits can optimize their fundraising efforts using data-driven insights.

- **Next steps:**  Pull request for Briefer Documentation to enhance beginner setup experience


## 5. Web Scraping ESG Supplier Data (Consulting project)

>**Note:** Code cannot be released due to IP belonging to the client
- **Description**: Developed a MVP to scrape and analyze ESG data from supplier websites.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated data collection for ESG metrics based on CSV upload of bank statement
  - Prepared data for analysis to support corporate decision-making processes.
